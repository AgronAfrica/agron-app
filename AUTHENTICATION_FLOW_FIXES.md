- Real-time validation feedback
- Better button state management

#### RegisterView.swift
- Comprehensive form validation for all fields
- Phone number validation (optional)
- Password confirmation validation
- Real-time validation feedback
- Better user experience with clear error messages

#### AuthManager.swift

- Better error message formatting
- Improved state management
- Added debugging support

#### APIService.swift
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Better error handling and messages
- Improved response parsing

#### ContentView.swift
- Better flow management between onboarding, subscription, and auth
- Proper state clearing when showing auth view
- Better handling of authentication state changes

### Backend Validation
- **Password Requirements**: 8 characters minimum (matching frontend)
- **Email Validation**: Proper email format validation
- **Role Validation**: Ensures valid user roles
- **Phone Validation**: Optional but validated when provided

## Testing the Authentication Flow

### 1. Registration Flow
1. Open the app
2. Complete onboarding (if first time)
3. Skip or complete subscription page
4. Tap "Register" tab
5. Fill in all required fields:
   - Name (2+ characters)
   - Email (valid format)
   - Password (8+ characters)
   - Confirm password (must match)
   - Select role (Farmer/Buyer/Transporter)
   - Phone (optional, but validated if provided)
6. Tap "Create Account"
7. Should see success message and redirect to dashboard

### 2. Login Flow
1. From auth screen, tap "Login" tab
2. Enter valid email and password
3. Tap "Login"
4. Should see success message and redirect to dashboard

### 3. Error Handling
- Try invalid email format → Should show validation error
- Try short password → Should show validation error
- Try mismatched passwords → Should show validation error
- Try invalid credentials → Should show API error message

## Debugging

The app now includes comprehensive logging:
- API requests and responses are logged to console
- Error messages are more descriptive
- Form validation errors are shown in real-time

To debug authentication issues:
1. Check console logs for API requests/responses
2. Verify backend is running and accessible
3. Check network connectivity
4. Verify backend routes are properly configured

## Backend Requirements

Ensure the Laravel backend is properly set up:
1. Database migrations run
2. Sanctum configured for API authentication
3. CORS configured for iOS app
4. API routes properly defined
5. User model with proper fillable fields

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed on backend using Laravel's Hash facade
- Tokens are stored securely in iOS Keychain
- API requests use Bearer token authentication
- Form validation happens on both frontend and backend
